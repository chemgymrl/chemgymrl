## Quick Start

For this quick start guide we will run through the Lab Manager demo as seen in this 
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy5dHE1rRKU&t=137s&ab_channel=NicholasPaquin)

To follow along with the video and test all the actions for yourself simply run the following commands `./chemgymrl`

```commandline
cd chemistrylab/lab
python manager
```

The demo goes over the rest of the capabilities of the lab manager.
