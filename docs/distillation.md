## Distillation Bench

The distillation bench is a process where a vessel with multiple materials is taken, and the goal is to isolate one of the materials in its own beaker by itself. This is done by utilizing the different boiling points of the materials in the vessel.
 
The way this works is that there is an initial vessel that would be put on a hot plate and the temperature of the vessel would be steadily increased, and this is done until the boiling point of a material in the vessel is attained. This will boil off the material and it will condensate in a tube to a secondary vessel, labeled as a condensation vessel. This process is repeated for every material in the initial vessel until the desired material has been isolated in its own vessel, and all unnecessary vessels would be put into a third vessel, labeled as a storage vessel.

In reality, however, heat does not condensate one material at a time as simply as ChemGymRL approaches it. For instance, say there are two liquids in a vessel, labeled X and Y. Liquid X has a boiling point of 100°C, and Liquid Y has a boiling point of 105°C. As much as we would like to imagine that at 100 degrees, liquid X would be fully evaporated and separated into its own vessel, what actually happens is that some of the heat that is being added is used to heat up the vessel, thus more heat needs to be added, at which point, the boiling point of both liquids has been attained, and the two liquids will not be so easily separated into their own respective vessels. The solution here applied by ChemGymRL is to assume that any added heat is used to boil off material to avoid such complexities.
