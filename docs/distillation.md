## Distillation Bench

The distillation bench is a process where a vessel with multiple materials is taken, and the goal is to isolate one of the materials in its own beaker by itself. This is done by utilizing the different boiling points of the materials in the vessel.
 
The way this works is that there is an initial vessel that would be put on a hot plate and the temperature of the vessel would be steadily increased, and this is done until the boiling point of a material in the vessel is attained. This will boil off the material and it will condensate in a tube to a secondary vessel, labeled as a condensation vessel. This process is repeated for every material in the initial vessel until the desired material has been isolated in its own vessel, and all unnecessary vessels would be put into a third vessel, labeled as a storage vessel.

The reward system works similarly in this bench as with the extraction bench, as the goal for the agent is to minimize the amount of vessels in which the desired material finds itself in at the conclusion of the experiment, and to isolate said material as much as possible.
