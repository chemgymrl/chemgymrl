## Extraction Bench

The purpose of the extraction bench is to extract materials from a beaker containing multiple materials, and this is done by using the different densities of material in the vessel, and then pipetting every material out separately. 

In some cases, materials do not separate themselves as simply as water and oil does, and for those cases, solutes are added into the vessel in order to separate the materials in the vessel and extract the desired materials, and it is up to the agent to determine which solute should be added in a given vessel to successfully separate materials. By introducing the right solutes, the user would be able to separate the materials present in the vessel since the solute will want to float up in certain materials, and float down in other materials. Once this occurs, it is up to the agent to extract the material desired by the user, and isolate it in its own vessel.
