## Extraction Bench

The purpose of the extraction bench is to extract materials from a beaker containing multiple materials, and this is done by using the different densities of material in the vessel, and then pipetting every material out separately. 

In some cases, materials do not separate themselves as simply as water and oil does, as usually when water and oil are in the same beaker, due to the different densities, the two substances end up separating themselves in the beaker, allowing a chemist to easily extract either of the liquids. However, most materials do not separate so easily, and for those cases, solutes are added into the vessel in order to separate the materials in the vessel and extract the desired materials, and it is up to the agent to determine which solute should be added in a given vessel to successfully separate materials. 

By introducing the right solutes, the user would be able to separate the materials present in the vessel since the solute will want to float up in certain materials, and float down in other materials. Once this occurs, it is up to the agent to extract the material desired by the user, and isolate it in its own vessel. The reward system reinforces good and bad outcomes in this bench in order to get the agent to maximize the purity of the desired material and to extract it in as few beakers as possible in order to isolate it, and to avoid splitting up the desired material in smaller portions across multiple beakers.
