# Glossary

Serves as a reference for some of the key terms used in this documentation.

## A

### Action

What the agent performs in an environment in order to obtain a reward.

### Agent

Who takes decisions in an environment based on rewards and punishments.

## B 

### Bench

A virtual environement that allows for a series of operations to occur.

## C

### Characterization

The process of analyzing a vessel such that we are able to determine its contents.

### Command Line

A place where a user can enter commands into the computer from a terminal.

## D

### Distillation

Distillation is a process where materials in a mixture are seperated using their boiling points.

## E

### Environment

Medium in which a Lab Manager and/or agent interacts with vessels or other agents performing necessary operations.

### Extraction

Extraction is a separation process consisting in the separation of a substance from a matrix using different densities.

## L

### Lab Manager

Lab managers direct actions and inspect results from sub agents that carry out tasks for individual benches. It also takes in materials from bench to bench using a vessel.

## M 
 
### Material

A material is a substance or mixture of substances that constitutes an object. 

## R

### Reinforcement Learning

A type of Machine Learning that uses an agent to perform actions in an environment in order to receive optimal outcomes and maximize rewards.

### Reward

Method used to train Machine Learning models to make optimal decisions.

## S

### Solute

The component that is dissolved in the solution.

### Solvent

The liquid in which a solute is dissolved to form a solution.

## V

### Vessel

A container used to hold mixtures or materials in ChemGymRL experiments.
