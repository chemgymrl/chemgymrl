Module to perform actions to isolate a desired material generated in a Wurtz reaction.
:title: distill_v0.py
:author: Mitchell Shahen, Mark Baula
:history: 2020-07-22
Available Actions for this Distillation Experiment:
0: Add/Remove Heat (Heat value multiplier, relative of maximal heat change)
1: Pour BV into B1 (Volume multiplier, relative to max_vessel_volume)
2: Pour B1 into B2 (Volume multiplier, relative to max_vessel_volume)
3: Wait for boil vessel temp to decrease towards room temp (if multiplier == 0, wait until room temp == true)
4: Done (Value doesn't matter)
Physical Representation:
A proper distillation experiment serves to extract one material from a vessel containing multiple
materials by utilizing the material's differing boiling points. Our distillation experiment
consists of three vessels: a distillation vessel which is placed on a source of heat and contains
all the material at the beginning of the experiment, the condensation vessel which is connected to
the distillation vessel via a tube and will contain the condensation of the material that is being
boiled off, and a storage vessel which is available such that the condensation vessel can be
emptied to make room for another evaporated material. The experiment begins by adding heat energy
to the distillation vessel which will serve to raise the temperature of the vessel and the
materials inside. The amount of energy required to raise the temperature of the distillation vessel
and the included materials is dependent on the specific heat capacities of the materials. Note: In
this virtual experiment, the vessel's overall heat capacity is calculated as the average heat
capacities of the materials in the vessel. As the temperature of the distillation vessel is
increased, we will eventually reach the lowest boiling point of the materials in the vessel. At
this point, any additional heat added will act to evaporate the material. The material, in it's
gaseous form, rises out of the distillation vessel and along the tube connecting the distillation
vessel to the condensation vessel, where the evaporated material condenses back into it's liquid
form. Note: It is assumed that the transfer of the gaseous material from the distillation vessel to
the condensation vessel happens instantaneously. Note: The amount of material evaporated is
dependent on the enthalpy of vapour of the material being evaporated. Once the entirety of the
material has been boiled off, the condensation vessel is drained into the storage vessel. Now that
the condensation beaker is empty, heat energy is once again added to the original beaker raising
its temperature until the next lowest boiling point is reached, thus repeating the above process.
The above process is repeated until the desired material has been completely evaporated out of the
distillation vessel into the condensation vessel, but before the condensation vessel has been
drained into the storage vessel. It is at this point that the desired material has been completely
isolated and we obtain a pure sample.
