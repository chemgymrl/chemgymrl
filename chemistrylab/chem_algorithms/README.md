# Chemistry Algorithms
Modules to be available in all benches and are used to facilitate the representation, storage, indentification, and utility of materials with bench-independence.

## Modules

- logger : Defines the logger class used to track processes and output log files.
- material : Defines each material as an object with properties such as boiling point and density.
- reward : Defines the reward systems used in each of the three environments.
- shelf : Defines a class to store vessels.
- util : Defines methods to manipulate materials in a vessel and to generate the state of an environment from a list of vessels.
- vessel : Defines the object to contain materials, contain characteristics of materials, and methods to manipulate the materials in a vessel.
