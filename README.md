A  chemistry laboratory environment populated with a collection of chemistry experiment sub-environments, based on the OpenAI Gym environment framework for use with reinforcement learning applications.

## Data Structure
volume: ml, amount: mole

### Bench Overview
The chemistrygym environment has three benches available: the reaction bench, the extraction bench, and the distillation bench. The reaction bench performs a series of reactions in a single vessel, the extraction bench moves materials between a series of vessels, and the distillation bench evaporates and isolates individual materials. Each bench utilizes vessels to contain materials and perform processes on the vessels. The reaction bench uses a single vessel while the extraction and distillation benches each use three vessels. Upon completing a bench, the final vessel(s), the vessel(s) containing the desired material or is of the most value, is(are) saved locally as a pickle file. Each bench can be initiated with an empty vessel(s) or be provided with a vessel(s) from previously completed benches. For the purposes of creating a realistic experiment, the workflow is intended to be the following.

reaction bench --> extraction bench --> distillation bench

Firstly, a series of reactions are performed in a reaction vessel and one material is designated as the "desired material". The reaction vessel is then saved and uploaded into the extraction bench. The extraction bench introduces at least one solute to allow for the individual movement of materials between three vessels. Any number of the final extraction vessels are saved and uploaded into the distillation bench. Note: more than one final extraction vessel may be of interest (ie. contains some amount of the desired material), but only one vessel can be loaded into the distillation bench at one time. The distillation bench applies heat energy to the uploaded vessel until a material begins to boil off into a secondary beaker and once the material has been completely boiled off that material is drained into a tertiary vessel. This process is repeated until the desired material has been completely isolated in its own vessel at which point the vessel is saved as it has 100% purity of the desired material.

### Reward Function
The reward function is crucial such that it is how the agents determine which actions are seen as positive and which actions are seen as negative. The current hierarchy of positive states has the amount of desired material present be of greater importance compared to the number of vessels containing the desired material. That being said, vessels containing of purity of less than 20%, with respect to the desired material, are considered unfit for continuation. For example, if extraction bench yields a vessel with 50% purity and another vessel with 10% purity, the vessel with 50% purity exceeds the purity requirement and is exempt from further actions in the extraction bench, while the vessel with 10% purity must still undergo extraction bench actions to increase the purity above the required purity threshold of 20%.

### Vessel
Important Variables |Structure | Description
---|---|---
_material_dict|{'material.name': [material(), amount], ...}|a dictionary holding all the material inside this vessel
_solute_dict|{'solute.name': {solvent.name: amount, ...}, ...}|dictionary that represents the solution
_event_dict|{'function name': function}|a dictionary holds the event functions of a vessel
_event_queue|[['event', parameters], ['event', parameters] ... ]|a queue of events to be performed by vessel
_feedback_queue|[['event', parameters], ['event', parameters] ... ]|a queue holding collected feedback from materials and unfinished events

#### An example of _material_dict and _solute_dict
(vessel with Na and Cl dissolved in H2O and C6H14)
```bash
H2O = material.H2O()
C6H14 = material.C6H14()
Na = material.Na()
Cl = material.Cl()

Na.set_charge(1.0)
Na.set_solute_flag(True)
Cl.set_charge(-1.0)
Cl.set_solute_flag(True)

material_dict = {'H2O': [H2O, 100], 'C6H14': [C6H14, 100], 'Na': [Na, 1.0], 'Cl': [Cl, 1.0]}
solute_dict = {'Na': {'H2O': 0.5, 'C6H14': 0.5}, 'Cl': {'H2O': 0.5, 'C6H14': 0.5}}
```

Important functions | Description
---|---
push_event_to_queue()|used to pass event into the vessel
_update_materials()|automatically called by push_event_to_queue(), execute events in _event_queue and _feedback_queue
_merge_event_queue()|merge the feedback_queue passed in, and all the default events (switches) are appended to _feedback_queue by this function

#### The Workflow
  
  1. Agent choose action from the action space of an environment.
  2. The environment does the calculation and update and generate events.
  3. At the end of each action, if the action affect a vessel, use push_event_to_queue() to push the event into the vessel, if no event generated, call the function with events=None.
  4. With push_event_to_queue() called, events are pushed into the vessel.
  5. _update_materials is automatically called and perform events in the events_queue.
  6. Each event has a corresponding event function, it first update properties of the vessel, then loop over the materials inside the vessel by calling the corresponding event functions of each material.
  7. The materials' event function will return feedback by calling the push_event_to_queue(), which contains feedback and unfinished event 
  8. The returned feedback is added to the _feedback_queue
  9. The the _merge_event_queue() is called on _feedback_queue, which merge the events in the feedback_queue to generate a merged_queue and add default event into it, then empty the _feedback_queue
  10. Then the merged_queue will be executed and new feedback are collected and added to _feedback_queue, which will be executed with the next action.

### State Structure
Each vessel has three matrices to represent the state:

[material_dict_matrix, solute_dict_matrix, layer_vector]

**material_dict_matrix (number of available material * 10):**

-|Density|Polarity|Temperature|Pressure|Solid Flag|Liquid Flag|Gas Flag|Charge|Molar Mass|Amount
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Air|

H|
H2|

**solute_dict_matrix (number of available material * number of available material):**

Each cell means how much of that solute (row) dissolved in that solvent (column)

-|Air|H2O|H|H2|.|.|.
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----
