        "The reaction bench environment is meant to as it sounds simulate a reaction, in most reaction benches the agent will have a number of reagents and the ability to play with the environmental conditions of the reaction and through doing this the agent is trying to maximize the yield of a certain desired material. For the reaction bench we use a reaction file which specifies the mechanics of a certain reaction or multiple reactions. For instance the Wurtz reaction is made up of 6 different reactions and as such is a very complicated reaction which the agent has to try and learn the mechanisms of the reaction environment it is in. For this lesson we will be using a simplified version of the wurtz reaction to introduce you to how actions affect the environment."
