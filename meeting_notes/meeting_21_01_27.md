# Meeting Notes

## Date: January 27, 2021

### Updates:
- Mark C. and Isaac: Paperwork.
- Chris: Working on submitting a paper.
- Sriram: Went through the chemistrygym walkthrough video and various papers posted ot the Slack channel by Mark and Isaac. Alerted everyone that a PPO algorithm is available in the `sriramrl` branch, which might not work with the newest commits to the master branch, but includes some useful tabular RL implementations. These implementations are useful to get a grasp on what is happening inside a RL implementation (ie. obtaining q values and the actions being taken) which is useful for everyone to take a look at.
- Nouha: Has been working on the PPO algorithm implementation, debugging some errors, and assisting co-op students with their lessons. Had a meeting with Mark and Isaac recently where they discussed improvements for the reward function including adding a cost analysis metric (an issue with more details is being added as an issue in the GitHub). Encouraged to consult with Chris about any issues with Sigma-Aldrich.
- Amanuel: Has had meetings with Nouha and Chris to discuss updates, recommendations, and improvements for the website. Has been working on the logo design. Provided a preview of the website during the meeting including ideas for the placement and organization of material. Referenced several websites as examples of well-structured and informative websites.
- Mark B.: Completed the reaction bench lessons and has begun to work on the extract bench lessons. He prepared and presented slides on his progress in working on the reaction bench lessons. Isaac suggested managing the decimal points of the variables being displayed and suggestions ot clearly define the difference between good and bad reward values. It was also suggested that the reaction bench lessons be cleaned up and to consult with Nouha and Chris.
- Nicholas: Completed working on the reaction bench lessons and has also begun working with the extraction bench. Also prepared a slideshow of his progress with the reaction bench. Added more reactions (disassociations) and has been adding functionality to instruct scientists on how to add their own reactions. Suggested creating a base template to streamline and simplify the production of more reaction files.
- Mitchell: Has been working on the infinite values issue in reaction bench and rectifying various other bugs in reaction and extraction bench. Preparing the environment to be merged into master once the infinite values issue is fixed.

### Looking Ahead:
- Chris: Will work on the distillation bench lessons in the coming days.
- Sriram:
- Nouha: Will look into the PPO algorithm implementation in the `sriramrl` branch.
- Amanuel: Continue developing the website and have a beta version ready within a few days.
- Mark B.: Move to working on the distillation bench lessons and peer review with Nicholas's work on the extract bench lessons.
- Nicholas: Continue working on the extraction bench lessons and peer review with Mark's work on the distillation bench lessons.
