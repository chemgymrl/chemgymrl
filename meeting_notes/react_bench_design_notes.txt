Thoughts on reaction Bench Design:

- Pass the vessel to the reaction file from the engine (no deconstruction)
- This will limit the interaction between the Reaction bench engine and the reaction file (which will make both of these much more readable/understandable)
- Add a method in the reaction file to deconstruct the vessel or update the vessel throughout
- I worry that if we want to update the vessel throughout, we will be forced to move all the reaction operations to the vessel class which is what we have done with the other benches (do not clutter the vessel class)
- Mark B. is already having difficulty following the chain of operations with distillation bench's use of the methods in the vessel class
