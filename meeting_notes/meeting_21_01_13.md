# Meeting Notes

## Date: January 13, 2021

- **Meeting Summary:** Focussed on implementation of reward model in current design of chemistry gym.
- **Present** : Amanuel, Chris, Isaac, Mark B, Mark C, Mitchell, Nicholas, Nouha, Sriram



## Mark, Sriram, Nouha, Chris and Isaac

- [ ] What is the experimental plan?
- [ ] is there another round of core API development needed to enable experiments
- [ ] set milestones for progress in project

## Isaac and Chris

- Lessons List: showing people/agents how the benches work
    - use these lessons as the initial training targets for RL agents
    - some are known are ready
    - Easy lessons: 1-10(?)
        - useful for people to understand
        - also useful for training the RL agents

## Nicholas
- using openai gym on various problems 

## Mark B
- some RL AI code setup as well
- looking at pytorch (aren't we using tensorflow?)
- [ ] implementing initial lessons from Chris
## Amanuel
- looked at code
- mountain car
- environment install
- looking at petting zoo website example as well
- [ ] make a basic hello world mockup of the system and what might be needed, show to everyone to discuss design
- [ ] initial sketch for website design
## Nouha
- reading papers on chemical robot synthesis research
- [ ] brainstorming on graph networks and PPO
- [ ] get those graphics that were initially created, shared with everyone:  Everyone can add to them but Amanuel will lead tracking what is done and what is needed
## Sriram
- [ ] watch mitchell's video and get up to date on the code
- [ ] thinking: what experiments need to be done? 
- questions:    
- Do we need entire new algorithms?
- Or any changes to the APIs?
## Chris
- [ ] think about and sketch out curriculum learning plan, level of complexity that you could teach the system about different scenarios on the existing benches
	- [ ] create three basic lessons
	- [ ] write it out by hand to it's clear to everyone
- Then co-ops 
	- [ ] add the formulas to the benches to run
	- [ ] implement them
	- [ ] create the documentation and images to explain them
## Mitchell
- review video of the various benches outlining how to access them and the code
- [X] send link out to everyone
